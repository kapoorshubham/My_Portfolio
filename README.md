## General info
The purpose of this project was for me to try out Djano for the first time as I have never used it before and I have been able to build this simple application in a small timeframe of 2 days. I found the experience to be fun and got to learn a lot of new things. I'm sure I would learn more as I dwell deeper into Django in the coming months.
